# Smart Reminders System Documentation

## Overview

The Smart Reminders system is an intelligent notification service designed specifically for real estate agents. It analyzes context, priorities, and behavioral patterns to deliver timely, actionable reminders that help agents never miss an opportunity or follow-up.

## How Smart Reminders Work

### 1. Intelligent Scheduling

The system automatically determines the optimal time to send reminders based on:

- **Time Intelligence**: Knows the best times for different activities
  - Follow-ups: 10 AM or 2 PM on weekdays (avoids weekends)
  - Appointments: 30 minutes before scheduled time
  - Tasks: 9 AM morning reminders
  - Deadlines: 24 hours advance notice
  - Hot opportunities: Immediate (within 5 minutes)

### 2. Priority Calculation

Reminders are automatically prioritized based on multiple factors:

**Scoring System:**
- Deal value > $1M: +3 points
- Deal value > $500K: +2 points
- Deal value > $250K: +1 point
- In pipeline > 30 days: +2 points
- In pipeline > 14 days: +1 point
- No contact > 7 days: +2 points
- No contact > 3 days: +1 point
- Opportunity type: +2 points
- Deadline type: +1 point

**Priority Levels:**
- **Urgent** (red): Score ≥ 5 - Requires immediate attention
- **High** (orange): Score ≥ 3 - Important, handle soon
- **Medium** (green): Score ≥ 1 - Standard priority
- **Low** (gray): Score < 1 - Can be handled when convenient

### 3. Smart Triggers

Reminders can be triggered by multiple conditions:

#### Time-Based Triggers
- Scheduled for specific times
- Automatically adjusted for optimal engagement times
- Skips weekends for business communications

#### Location-Based Triggers
- Activates when approaching a property (1km radius)
- Perfect for appointment reminders
- Provides navigation options

#### Activity-Based Triggers
- Monitors contact patterns
- Alerts when a lead hasn't been contacted in X days
- Tracks deal momentum

#### Deal Stage Triggers
- Monitors deal progression
- Alerts on stage changes
- Reminds about stalled deals

### 4. Contextual Actions

Each reminder comes with smart, context-aware actions:

**Follow-up Reminders:**
- Call Now (primary)
- Send Email
- Schedule Meeting

**Appointment Reminders:**
- Get Directions (primary)
- View Details
- Reschedule

**Task Reminders:**
- Mark Complete (primary)
- View Task
- Snooze (15 minutes)

**Opportunity Reminders:**
- Contact Lead (primary)
- Send Listings
- Schedule Showing

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Follow-up Reminder

```typescript
smartReminders.createSmartReminder({
  type: 'follow-up',
  subject: 'John Smith',
  context: {
    clientId: 'client-123',
    dealValue: 750000,
    lastContact: new Date('2024-01-15'),
    daysInPipeline: 21
  }
});
```

This will:
1. Calculate priority as "high" (deal > $500K + 21 days in pipeline)
2. Schedule for 10 AM next business day
3. Create notification with call/email/schedule actions
4. Monitor for 3+ days of no contact

### Creating an Appointment Reminder

```typescript
smartReminders.createSmartReminder({
  type: 'appointment',
  subject: 'Property Showing - 123 Main St',
  context: {
    propertyId: 'prop-456',
    clientId: 'client-789'
  },
  baseTime: new Date('2024-01-20T14:00:00')
});
```

This will:
1. Set reminder for 30 minutes before (1:30 PM)
2. Enable location-based trigger when approaching property
3. Provide navigation and reschedule options

### Creating an Opportunity Alert

```typescript
smartReminders.createSmartReminder({
  type: 'opportunity',
  subject: 'Hot Lead - Sarah Johnson',
  context: {
    clientId: 'client-hot-001',
    dealValue: 1200000
  }
});
```

This will:
1. Set as "urgent" priority (deal > $1M + opportunity type)
2. Trigger within 5 minutes
3. Require interaction (won't auto-dismiss)
4. Provide immediate action options
